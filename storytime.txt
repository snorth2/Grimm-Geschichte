Yesterday, I woke up, put on my Lederhose and walked to the Baeckerei for some Gebaeck.
On my walk, I saw a very cute Hund and pet him on the head.
But then the Hund got scared and ran away faster than a BMW.
Not to worry, I had Brot to feed its owner.
Perhaps he was excited to eat a Bratwurst!
I chased the hund to the local Eltz.
The hund escaped and I was disappointed to find out that the eltz had no klimaanlage.
But thankfully, it had a nice biergarten where I could cool off.
In Berlin, the Hauptstrasse was filled with dancers with nice Dirndels.
There were also Brot, Bratwurst, and Gebaeck vendors!
Germans are very wettbewerbsfaehig, and they love doing Apfelkuchen-eating contests.
Sometimes they take a break from eating apfelkuchen to have some doener.
